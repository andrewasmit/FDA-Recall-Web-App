FDA Food Recalls

Overview:
This web app is designed to display food recalls issues by the FDA. You have the ability to search and filter the recalls by your state to see if any apply directly to where you live.

Instructions: 
Upon visiting the website, all recalls should display on the screen. This will happen automatically and should not require any user interaction to be able to start scrolling through the food recalls. 

If you wanted to narrow down the search results by filtering recalls in each state, simply use the dropdown menu at the top of the site and click on which state you would like to filter search results for. Upon the click of the mouse, filtered search results will be displayed automatically without needing to refresh the page. 

If any states do not curently have any recalls in the FDA database, the screen should throw an alert stating that "There are no recalls curently in this state."

After any filtering of recalls by state, simply click the "All Recalls" button to display all recalls as they were when you first entered the web page.
